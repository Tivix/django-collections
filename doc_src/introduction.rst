Introduction to Django Collections
==================================

Django Collections provides a way to group and filter content through pre-set terms and configured aspects. It provides a user-friendly way of browsing content of different types, but with similar themes. And it doesn't require constant maintenance to add items to the collections.

Django Collections is a search interface. Each named Collection is really a pre-set search. It uses one or more search aggregators, like `Haystack`_\ , to provide the results and drive the filters (facets).
